# Coffee Shop Management System

In Coffee shop management system, there are seven relational models as follows:
1)Coffee Shop
2)Order
3)Offer (weak entity)
4)Staff
5)Payment
6)Promotion
7)Product

All these entities together make this system work. A realistic experience to user is made by making a GUI where user can interact with all the relational entities by just getting registered into the system. PHP and mySQL is used in backend and HTML and CSS in frontend.
All the database gets stored in their corresponding files, and can be updated or deleted according to the wish of user. Insertion of new entries is also possible and all these functions work on basic laws of relational model.
